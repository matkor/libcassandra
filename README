== libcassandra

A C++ wrapper library for the interface to cassandra generated by thrift. This library is based on
the Java client hector.

The master branch will follow along with Cassandra trunk. Branches corresponding to stable releases
of Cassandra will be available. Downloads of these branches are also provided.

The current master and 0.7.0 branches will work with Apache Cassandra 0.7.x. .  Internal libgenthrift
generated by thrift 0.5.0

== Install

$ ./config/autorun.sh
$ ./configure

or 
$ ./autogen.sh

or (for more FHS layouts)
$ ./config/pld_like_autorun.sh

and:
$ make 
$ make install

To build test/example programs run:
$ make check 

== Running unit tests 
(Not mainteined)

If Google's C++ unit test framework, gtest, is installed on your machine, the unit tests can be run.

$ make check

The unit tests require a cassandra server with the default out of the box storage-conf.xml file to be running.

== Compiling apps with libcassandra

$ g++ file.cc -lcassandra  -I/usr/include/thrift/

Obviously, you should modify the line for your include to be where your thrift headers are
installed.
